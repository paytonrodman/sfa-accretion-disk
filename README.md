A Jupyter notebook containing some of the data analysis for my final project of the [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/) Data for Science Residency Programme (July-August 2021).

The ```.ipynb``` file cannot be run within GitHub but does already display the output of all cells.

If you would like to run the notebook yourself, clone the respository - everything you need is contained within ```/images/``` and ```/data/```.

The original dataset used in this analysis is currently private.
